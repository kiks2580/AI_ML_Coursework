Summary findings 

41% of the total users chose to accept the bar coupons
Users who go to the bar more than 3 times were less prone to accept the bar coupons as they probably had a recurring membership
Users older than 25 accepted the bar coupons, as the rest of the younger generation had drinking age restrictions or were not interested in having a drink
